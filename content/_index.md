### COLLABORATION FOR SYSTEMIC CHANGE

Impact requires significant, dedicated collaboration and collective action. The environmental and social challenges we face require fundamental systemic changes in the way we do business.  Auckland needs an ecosystem of change makers, social entrepreneurs, enablers, innovators, and intrapreneurs that will provoke this systemic change together. Lets co-create entrepreneurship that accelerates the transition to a greener and fairer planet.
