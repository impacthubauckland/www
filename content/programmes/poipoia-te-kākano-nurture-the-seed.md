Here’s what previous participants have to say

> The Back to Purpose Programme is the best thing that has happened to my business so far. I have especially embraced the idea of impact and gained more confidence to tell people about the impact they are making with the products I sell. I am currently rebranding and I look forward to applying the lessons I have learned from the workshops. Thank you Impact Hub, Ella, Paul, and all the other wonderful facilitators
