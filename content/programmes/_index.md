### Poipoia te Kākano

An 10 week programme for impact driven entrepreneurs. Through capacity-building workshops, coaching and mentoring, Poipoia te Kākano (PtK) is here to up-skill, inspire and connect a new wave of change-makers.  Impact Hub’s intention is to offer inspiration, support and connection to a new wave of change-makers.

[{{< ctabutton text="APPLY NOW" link="/about" >}}](https://forms.gle/Jr9ohXMKVyTogHke7)

The programme will focus on business ideation, business optimisation and entrepreneurial mindset through capacity building workshops, mentoring and coaching, networking opportunities in the innovative Kiwi startup scene and connection to either jobs or capital.

This programme is in partnership by Kāinga Ora.  In the development of new neighbourhoods, we see many opportunities for supporting community economic development space. Enabling and supporting the locally led businesses to succeed in our new urban areas is a new approach for Kāinga Ora.  Supporting local economic development aligns purposefully with a mandate to support thriving communities in our Large Scale Development neighbourhoods’ particularly in those where commercial space is planned as part of the new urban design masterplan.

The end goal of the programme is two-fold. One, to equip aspiring young entrepreneurs with the tools and mindset required to start a business and two, to connect them to our network of inspiring impact enterprises, where they have the opportunity to volunteer or become a part of the (founding) team.

Candidates of all ages and backgrounds are welcome to apply. You do not have to have a clear idea, nor do you have to have previous experience in business or entrepreneurship to enter the programme. The only entry criteria is a healthy dose of motivation and drive!

What's the focus?
This 10-week ‘pressure-cooker’ of a programme is designed to fast track your entrepreneurial journey. You will be inspired and enabled to create and test a new business idea or innovate your existing business.

By the end of the programme, you can expect to be equipped with the tools and entrepreneurial mindset required to create your own impact-driven business, and be connected to a vibrant community of entrepreneurs and start-ups.

### What's the time commitment?

The programme will be delivered over 10 weeks with sessions ranging from 2-3 hours. Participants can expect to invest an additional 3-5 hours per week in the programme, which includes 1-2-1 coaching calls and self-study.

We end with a pitch and networking event, where participants will have the opportunity to pitch their business idea and network with entrepreneurs, start-ups, investors, funders and more. Participants are expected to attend 80% of the programme to be eligible to pitch.

### What topics will be covered?

We will cover a range of topics relevant to creating and testing a business idea and setting up a purpose-led start-up. Some examples include:

* Design Thinking, 
* Business Modelling, 
* Legal Fundamentals, 
* Impact Measurement, 
* Cash Flow Forecasting & Management,
* Marketing Strategies and 
* Customer/User Discovery and Experience.

These topics will be delivered by experts in the field. Developing an entrepreneurial mindset and knowing yourself is also key to everyone’s entrepreneurial journey. For that reason, we will also include discussions on what it means to have an Entrepreneurial Mindset and some key differences between being an entrepreneur vs an employee.

### What makes Poipoia te Kākano special?

At Poipoia te kākano, we do not host workshops where you sit down, listen and leave. We focus on action! Our expert-led workshops are designed to be interactive and practical, so that you have something to work on after every session. You will have key deliverables to work towards and you will pitch your business idea to an audience at the end of the programme.

Furthermore, we bring in entrepreneurs from the impact sector to both lead workshops and share their personal stories and advice. There is also the opportunity to network and potentially join inspiring impact enterprises at the end of the programme as a volunteer or team member.

Alongside group activities like the high quality capacity building workshops, you will also receive 1-2-1 business coaching and mindset coaching from our team, so that you get the individual support you need to flourish and succeed.

### How can you apply?

Applications for the Poipoia te kākano programme for 2022 are now open until 20 June 2022.

Successful participants will receive a free 6-month membership to Impact Hub Auckland and benefit from discounts to workshops, events, programmes.
