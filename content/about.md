The small and mighty IHA team is a driving force behind this new impact eco-system venture. We have collaborated with our sister team at Impact Hub Waikato (IHW) who have spent countless hours developing systems, designing solutions, and stewarding relationships to serve a growing network of stakeholders. Each entrepreneurial team member brings unique skills from their own impact business to share with the change makers of TƒÅmaki Makaurau.
