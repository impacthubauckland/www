Our story dates back to 2012, when a collaborative project led by Auckland Council, gathered together a group of practitioners, training providers and academics to consider on how to best support the development of social enterprise in Tāmaki Makaurau. 

In 2015, Social Enterprise Auckland (SEA) was established as a member based organisation (an Incorporated Society) in order to develop a vehicle for social enterprises and their supporters to lead this effort and create an environment in which social enterprise is just a normal way of doing business.

Fast forward to 2020, when the board of SEA, who included Paul Kerssans from Impact Hub Waikato, decided to investigate the possibility of joining the global Impact Hub movement.   During 2021, a series of hui (meetings) were ran across the city with entrepreneurs, intrapreneurs, local government and charities to investigate the appetite for Impact Hub Auckland.

The small and mighty IHA team is a driving force behind this new impact eco-system venture. We have collaborated with our sister team at Impact Hub Waikato (IHW) who have spent countless hours developing systems, designing solutions, and stewarding relationships to serve a growing network of stakeholders. Each entrepreneurial team member brings unique skills from their own impact business to share with the change makers of Tāmaki Makaurau.
