### Our Story

Our story begins in 2020, when the board of Social Enterprise Auckland (SEA), who included Paul Kerssans from Impact Hub Waikato, decided to join the global Impact Hub movement to create systemic positive changes for people and the planet through business.  

Our vision is to make impact-driven entrepreneurship a reality for everyone.
Impact cannot happen in isolation, it requires collective action. Thatâ€™s why, since 2015, Social Enterprise Auckland now Impact Hub Auckland have been building an ecosystem of social entrepreneurs, enablers, innovators, and intrapreneurs that provoke change together.
We know that solutions come in different shapes and sizes: inspiring events, business support, meeting and event space, an online platform. A flexible, tailored mix of these solutions, combined with our locally rooted, global community, is how we enable growth in our members.

### Inclusive & sustainable entrepreneurship

We believe that the time to act is now - collaboratively and quickly. 

We are facing a climate and biodiversity crisis. The world is not on track to achieving its sustainability objectives. On the contrary: on many measures, from CO2 emissions to species loss, we are moving in the opposite direction. We are not doing well creating a more equal world either. In many places across the globe, the inequality gap is widening. Nearly half of humanity lives on less than $5.50 a day.

Entrepreneurship accelerates the transition to a greener and fairer planet.
